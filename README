A simple example using Java's image reading, writing, and processing APIs. I
often use Java for this kind of thing because it is both powerful, flexible
and ubiquitous.  The downside is that it is Java ;)

Build: 
  javac ImageProc.java

Run: 
  java ImageProc

Running ImageProc will read turtle.jpg, convert it to grayscale, mess with the
raw pixels a bit, and then write the result to output.jpg. I do not claim this
is the best way to accomplish this task, but it is a way.
